# Project Title: Supply Chain Optimization: From Data to Decisions

## Project Overview:

Dataset: DataCoSupplyChainDataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis/code)

Efficient supply chain management is critical for business success, ensuring that products are delivered on time while optimizing costs and customer satisfaction.

## Objectives:

The objective of this project is to analyze and optimize supply chain performance by identifying key inefficiencies in order fulfillment, shipping delays, and regional sales distribution. Through data-driven insights, the project aims to improve delivery reliability, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize profitability by addressing logistical bottlenecks, refining shipping strategies, and aligning inventory management with demand patterns.

## Project Structure:
1. Order-Related Descriptive
2.  Shipping & Delivery Performance
3.  Customer Behavior & Segmentation
4.  Product & Category Insights
5.  Inventory & Supply Chain Efficiency
6.  Key Findings & Business Recommendations

## Outcome:

1. Order-Related Insights
- Total sales: 36.45M
- Total profit: 3.93M
- High total sales and profit, but an average order value of $204.3 suggests a mix of high- and low-ticket items.
- Top-performing regions (Central America, Western Europe, etc.) drive most orders and profits, while underperforming regions (Central Asia, Canada, Southern Africa, etc.) lag behind.

Recommendations:
- Expand operations in high-performing regions with targeted marketing.
- Investigate barriers in underperforming regions (logistics, demand, pricing issues).
- Customer acquisition strategy: With 18,529 unique customers, assess ways to improve retention and upselling.

2. Shipping & Delivery Performance
- On-time delivery rate is only 40.88%, 4.31% canceled, and 54.81% of orders are late.
- First-class shipping has the highest delay (95.3%), followed by second-class (76.6%). Standard-class performs best.
- Late deliveries happen across all regions, suggesting internal logistics or warehouse issues rather than regional performance issues.

Recommendations:
- Revise delivery scheduling algorithms: Adjust estimated delivery times to be more realistic.
- Improve warehouse efficiency: Since delays arenâ€™t regional, warehouse bottlenecks may be an issue. Look at order processing times.
- Optimize shipping mode selection: Since standard-class is most reliable, encourage its use for non-urgent shipments.
- Investigate supplier delays: If certain products/categories are consistently late, supply chain issues could be the root cause.
